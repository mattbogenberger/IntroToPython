Many of these examples had a `purr()` method that didn't depend on anything that was specific to an instance of an object. While normally we would make a copy of this method for each object we created in memory, we can instead declare it as a static method. This means that no matter how many cat objects we create, they will all share the same `purr()` method stored in memory.\n",
