    "Functions are the simplest way to group together a collection of statements in python, as with most languages. This has two main purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It makes code more readable by grouping together code that accomplishes a specific task\n",
    "2. It allows us to reuse code in different parts of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like the `print()` function we've already been using are examples of code reuse- we can print stuff to the console as many times as we want without explaining to the python interpreter how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in python are defined using the `def` keyword, and are indented to show what is part of the function. It's a good idea to leave a blank line after the function to keep it visually seperated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full syntax is: \n",
    "```\n",
    "def <function name>(<arguments>):\n",
    "    # function definition\n",
    "    return true\n",
    "\n",
    "# code that is not part of the function.\n",
    "# to call the function we use the name followed by ()\n",
    "\n",
    "<function name>()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
