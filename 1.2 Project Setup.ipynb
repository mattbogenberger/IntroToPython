    "# Local Project Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning the Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the code for this series as a zip file, but it's easier to maintain your code by using git (and also best practice). You'll need to have git installed on your machine for this: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Having your own Github account is also helpful, but not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to interact with git on your computer. Visual Studio Code has a tab for it on the left navigation menu (the icon that looks a bit like a Y), you can download seperate clients like Github Desktop or Source Tree, or you can work with it using a command line interface. People often find it easier to start with a UI and then try different methods to see what works best for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the code from GitHub, create a folder on your computer where you want to keep the project and open it in VSC. In the git tab, click the button to initialize the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VSC initialize repo option](images/InitializeRepo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the same sidebar, open the menu and choose Clone\n",
    "\n",
    "![VSC add remote](images/VSCCloneRepo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the text box paste the URL \"https://github.com/HealthyGamer/IntroToPython.git\". You can also get this link by going to a repo on GitHub and clicking the green Code button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Github Clone](images/CloneFromGithub.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the folder you are currently in and add it to the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending changes back to your own GitHub account requires forking the repo, which you can read about here: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot folder has the completed project code, but it will be helpful if you build it yourself. Create a new folder in this project or whereever you want to build your bot (suggested folder name is demobot if you create it within this project).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create venv\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern coding, we often use packages written by other people in the tech community to drastically improve development time. Package managers help us to add and maintain our packages within a given project. In python, the most popular manager is pip, which comes bundled in your python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to add packages to a project. There is global scope, which allows you to access the package from any project on your machine, and local scope which makes it available to just that project. In most cases, you want to use a local scope so that you can use different versions of the same package in different projects, but pip defaults to global scope. To add packages to local scope, we need to create a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new environment, ask python to create with the following command. Depending on your environment, you may need to call `python3` instead of `python`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv demobot\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add a new folder to your project with a few new things in it. Generally, you'll want to leave those files alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "![new venv](images/NewVenv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the series we'll work within that folder. You can open it in a new VSC instance or just point your terminal at it by running `cd demobot`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are in that folder, we need to tell python to activate the environment so it will be used as we move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#Windows\n",
    "./Scripts/activate.ps1\n",
    "#Mac or Linux\n",
    "source /Scripts/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get `Scripts\\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.` error you can run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Keep in mind this makes your system slightly less secure- make sure not to run random PowerShell scripts you've downloaded. ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add Packages\n",
    "Now that we have a seperate environment there are a couple of packages that we'll need for this project. `pip install {package name}` is the command we need to run. We can add multiple packages by listing them with spaces in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install python-dotenv discord.py discord-py-interactions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get the error 'Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using.....' try running `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "## .env File\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project there is a file called `.env.template`. We want to make a copy and rename it to `.env`. This is where you'll put things like your bot's Discord key. That way we have one place where we can put that kind of stuff later and it's easier to avoid committing passwords to a public Github (if we were doing that).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get the Discord key in the next file, but for now we can fill in the \"Guild ID\". This is the old name for a swerver in Discord. In the settings, enable developer mode. This will allow you to right-click the server and copy the ID."
